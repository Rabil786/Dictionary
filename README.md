# Dictionary

This is a project for my Computer Organization and Assembly Language course. We created a dictionary as part of this project. The user will first enter a word to search for it, and the search engine will look up that word in a dictionary, returning the word's meaning and synonyms along with the search results if the word is found in the dictionary, else it will return that the term was not found.
